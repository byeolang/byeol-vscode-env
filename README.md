# Byeol VS Code development environment configuration

* Provides settings for debugging `byeol` programming interpreter with VS Code.

### Prerequisites

* You need the binary of `byeol`. Since you need to compile from the source code,
you need to have an envrionment where byeol can be built from
[byeol](https://github.com/byeol-org/byeol).
* I recommend installing the `C/C++` extension distributed by Microsoft for VS Code.
